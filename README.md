# Approach
I wanted to expand on the idea of collecting 'things', after doing a music database app previously. I wanted to be able to use a public api to reference movie titles, return the included information and share that with the user. Then, that particular movie could be saved to the user's personal collection. 

The collection of a user can be viewed after logging into the associated account.
